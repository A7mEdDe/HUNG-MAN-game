1. importaword
"""
This function imports a random word from a file named "words.txt".
It reads the file, splits the content into a list of words, and selects one randomly.
The selected word is converted to lowercase, split into a list of characters, and sorted.
The function returns the original word and the sorted list of its characters.
"""

2. checker
"""
This function checks if the guessed letter (new_litter) is in the new word (new_word).
If it is, it adds the letter to both the correct guesses list (correct) and the player's current word (my_word),
sorting my_word afterwards. If the guessed letter appears more than once, it is added multiple times to my_word.
The function updates and prints the hidden word display using hd() and returns the updated correct list, my_word,
and the number of remaining tries.
"""

3. hd
"""
This function displays the current state of the hidden word.
It iterates through each character in the word and checks if it has been correctly guessed (present in the correct list).
If the character has been guessed, it is added to the display string; otherwise, an underscore (_) is added. The resulting string is printed.
"""

4. input_litter
"""
This function handles the input of a new letter from the player.
It continues to prompt for input until the player either wins or runs out of tries.
The input is converted to lowercase and the first character is taken as the guessed letter.
If the letter has already been guessed (in history), a message is printed. If the letter is in the new word (new_word),
it is added to the history. If not, it is added to the history, tries are decremented, and a message is printed.
The function returns the guessed letter, updated history, and remaining tries.
"""

5. printer
"""
This function prints the final game result.
If the player's current word (my_word) matches the new word (new_word), a winning message is printed.
If the player runs out of tries, a game-over message is printed.
"""

6. Main Game Loop
"""
This is the main game loop.
It starts by importing a word and its sorted character list using importaword().
The loop continues as long as the player has tries left and has not guessed the word.
In each iteration, the hidden word is displayed using hd(), a new letter is inputted using input_litter(),
the guess is checked using checker(), and the game status is printed using printer(). 
Additionally, the current state of new_word, correct, history, and my_word is printed for debugging purposes.
